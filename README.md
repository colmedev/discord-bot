cd discord-bot
```

### 2. Install pnpm (if you don't have it installed globally)

You can install pnpm globally using npm with the following command:

npm install -g pnpm
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

## Database Setup

### 1. Prisma Configuration

Make sure you have configured the Prisma connection in the `.env` file with your database settings.

### 2. Generate Prisma Client

After setting up your database connection, generate the Prisma client by running:

```sh
pnpm db:generate
```

This will create the Prisma client necessary to interact with your database.

## Running the Project

Once all dependencies are installed and the Prisma client is generated, you can start the bot in development mode using the following command:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This will start the bot locally, allowing you to test its functionality.

## Discord Developer Portal Setup

If you havenâ€™t already created a Discord bot, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).
2. Create a new application and add a bot to it.
3. Copy the **bot token** from the application settings.
4. Set up your `.env` file with the following content:

   ```sh
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
   ```

   Replace `your-bot-token-here` with the actual bot token you copied from the developer portal.
